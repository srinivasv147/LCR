Example Paper For Reproducibility
=
This project basically illustrates  a way to present scientific papers that are reproducible.
We have plots that are generated from code that is openly available and anyone who wants to build the output from scratch can run make.
The requirements for this project are listed below:
numpy
matplotlib
ffmpeg
unittest
down load these dependencies on your system and run make to build the paper.
